# WDD #TechItForward Hackathon @Google - October 2018

Here, you can find projects that attendeets worked on during the WDD #TechItForward Hackathon hosted by Google.

## About WDD

[WDD (Women Driven Development)](https://womendrivendev.org/) is an organisation founded by [two software eingineers](https://womendrivendev.org/team), Phoebe Greig and Misa Ogura, with the aim to drive more diversity and inclusion in tech :rainbow: and facilitate the sponsor/sponsee relationships in more organic ways :handshake:

We want to achieve this by bringing gender minorities and tech leaders together in the form of hackathons and other practical events.

[WDD Tech It Forward](https://womendrivendev.org/events) is a hackathon where the focus is on the quality of the code, the people and the journey, with the aim of using technology to support communities and _tech things forward_ :muscle:

## What is this repo for

WDD advocates for the open source community - each project belongs to their own creators. We think it's important that these projects are available for people to browse.

In each entry, you will find a project overview such as how the idea came about or sources of inspiration, as well as the acknowledgement towards the tools/data sources used, and links to find more about the project.

## How to add your project (for #TechItForward Oct 2018 attendees)

0. You are welcome to create a project repository, anywhere you like. In some cases your project might not even require a repo!
1. Fork this repository.
2. Create a new markdown file (e.g. `my-shiny-project.md`) under the [projects directory](./projects).
3. Copy the contents of the [template](./projects/TEMPLATE.md) into the file just created.
4. Edit accordingly. It doesn't have to be complete, just fill out as much information as possible!
5. When you're done, raise a pull request (PR) against the master branch of this repo. You can find an example PR [here](https://github.com/womendrivendev/google-oct-2018/pull/1).
6. The idea is that you will update the file and push more commits to the PR as your project evolves.
7. After the hackathon, we will merge all the PRs.
8. As you work on the project, even after the hackathon, feel free to raise more PRs. We'll keep an eye out!
