# Move My Map

## About

- What problem is it trying to solve?

Helping people who cannot easily use a mouse or keyboard to navigate Google StreetView using head movements.

- What was the motivation behind?

Wanted to try using TensorFlow JS to solve a real-world accessibility issue.

- How did you come up with the idea?

 Originally had a maps based idea to help people find a great place to live based on local communities, but finding the data to make this a useful tool proved difficult. So the team had a pivot, sticking with maps bu focussing more on the user interaction with the map.
