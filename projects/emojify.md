# Team A AKA The A Team - Emojify

inside voice is an app for children, young adults and adolescents to journal emotional and experiential content using visual cues like emojis.

Mental health issues among young people and women in particular are rising at an alarming rate.

Journaling has been shown to have positive effects on mental health and general well being. It is not a cure for mental illness but it is a vital first step and a tool in a person's self care practice.

This was inspired by a piece on radio 4 woman's hour about the therapeutic approach to mental health challenges that children face.

The therapist described her use of coloured wrist bands to foster communication about the patient's internal state. Sessions would be tailored to suit the patient's choice and how it impacted.

The app idea extends and includes this use case.
