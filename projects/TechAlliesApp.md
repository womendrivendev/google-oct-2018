# Tech Allies App

## About

Who is it for

- People who identify as a woman (exisiting developers or new starters or ) who want to go to a meetup / mentorship / support who are not confident to attend alone
- People who want to check the diversity of a meetup
- People who want to find like minded people

- Endorsements
  Mentoree: advise, mentorship, help breaking into a male-dominated industry, exposure to other female developers
  Mentor: giving back, meeting potential new hires (this is not aimed at getting jobs and not recruiters, but is useful from an organic point of view), exchange of information/technologies etc
  What problem is it trying to solve?
  Male-dominated industry
  hard to find a mentor/mentoree within current company, or else few to choose from.  
  Like speed dating and tinder dates, there's less pressure on the meeting as the idea is to go on many and learn from lots and then develop one or two into a mentor relationship.

What was the motivation behind?/What inspired you?

Personally, I don't work with any female developers and have very few in my network. So it would be nice to meet more - and on a less formal basis where if it doesn’t develop into a mentor-relationship, its still super useful to have just 30 minutes of knowledge passed around over coffee.

How did you come up with the idea?
My boss literally said to me in a one-to-one that he'd like to set me up with a mentor but there were no actual female developers in the company… (so that conversation sort of fizzled out)

Other thoughts
I think it could be useful to look at linking up pairs who have wants (like python, angular etc) with those with 'haves' (like python experience, currently working on a banking blockchain etc)
like linkedIn, you could have a 'connect' button that indicates you're willing to meetup or chat online
I dunno if I like the idea of 'rating' after meetups, but maybe you could 'endorse' someone back, like if you had a long interesting chat about chatbots, then you could endorse that person for 'chatbots' so the app knows to add a weighting to that topic as it was verified.
