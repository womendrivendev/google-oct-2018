# VentBot

## About

The bot can be added as part of any platform, whether it is mobile or web based. It is aimed at employees who deal with issues related to harassment and inclusion at work.

Often, people facing a stressful work environment are looking for a safe place to vent, or to look up help and support if the problem persists or has been diagnosed as something more serious.
