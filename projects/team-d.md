# Inspobot

## About
- What/who is it for?
This is a chatbot that can be called on when you are feeling a bout of imposter syndrome coming on.
The user can ask for quotes / facts about inspirational women / inspirational talks / fun gifs and the bot will serve these resources.

- What problem is it trying to solve?
Give some confidence and inspiration to women in tech.

- What was the motivation behind?
In a industry where women are under represented, we have all experienced imposter syndrome. We often feel like we are alone in these moments and the motivation behind this project is to provide women with stories and quotes to let them know they are not.
