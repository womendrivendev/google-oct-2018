## About

Tell us about your project!

Here are some questions to help you get going...

- What/who is it for?
Uncovering bias towards women in tech in comments on Github.  

- What problem is it trying to solve?
We're hoping that in in understanding the problem area more we'll be able to help solve it.

- What motivated/inspired you?
We wanted to follow on from the research in July 2016, which found that PRs created by women were more likely to be
accepted 
then those created by men, but only if they were not identifiable women.

- How did you come up with the idea?
It felt right to use some of the GCP tools given the location and we wanted to apply them to aid gaining visibility 
on the barriers faced by 
minorities (specifically women)
 in tech.
